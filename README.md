# Demo Streaming

## Instructions to run App

Clone the repo, cd demo-streaming and run npm install && npm start or yarn install && yarn start. That's it!

## Decisions Decisions...

The goal was to create this application as close to a "real world" example as possible. The decision on the technical and architectural design and build was based on such. React was utilized with redux and Material UI to set a solid foundation for this rather straight-forward app as to the technologies and flow that may be utilized on an actual team. The app is stuctured and neatly organized, keeping file patterns the same across the application in terms general set up, order of imports, imports ordered alphabetically. Attention to detail is how I approach any and every project.

## Improvements

Some of the things I could have improved is the styling of certain components, taking the time to align them perfectly, especially on mobile breakpoints.

## With More Time...

I would continue to build beyond the app requirements. A Log in page was included. A sign up page would have also been included. On the series and movies pages I would have added on onClick for each title that would open up some type of modal to display the desciption of each program. Whatever way I could have made the app more complete.
